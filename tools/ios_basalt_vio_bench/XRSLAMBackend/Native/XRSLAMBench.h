 * Stable C boundary around the frozen OpenXRLab XRSLAM generic C++ core at
 * 4beb1a942f33da9afbfae2d70e2c641cfc2bb675. This adapter does not use ARKit,
 * RealityKit, XRSLAM_iOS, or any alternate/synthetic estimator.
 *
 * Calls which submit sensors and advance frames must be serialized by the
 * caller. IMU events are forwarded synchronously in accepted callback order,
 * matching the official iOS sample. One create-time preallocated grayscale
 * slot holds the image only between push_image and run_one_frame; it cannot
 * grow. Monotonicity is checked per sensor stream. The only timestamp
 * conversion is ns -> seconds at the exact upstream C ABI boundary; no
 * camera/IMU offset is applied here.

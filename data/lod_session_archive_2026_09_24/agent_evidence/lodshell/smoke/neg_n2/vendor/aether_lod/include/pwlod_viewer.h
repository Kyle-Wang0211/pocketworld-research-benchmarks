// pwlod_viewer.h -- FROZEN C ABI (v1) between the PocketWorld point-cloud LOD engine
// (Aether3D, aether_cpp/include/aether/pointcloud_lod_render/) and each platform shell
// (iOS now; Android / HarmonyOS later).
//
// Frozen by the coordinating session on 2026-09-24 (plan LOD_ARLOOPBENCH_PLAN_20260924.md,
// user choices A1 + B1 + orthographic via Cesium). Neither side edits this file; a needed
// change is reported back to the coordinator, who changes it for both sides at once.
//
// Rules
//   * No platform types. Only <stdint.h> and the Dawn C header (webgpu.h sha256 6d632738...).
//     IOSurface / AHardwareBuffer / OHNativeWindow are imported by the SHELL into a
//     WGPUSharedTextureMemory + WGPUTexture on the device this library created.
//   * Plan 3b / B1 (Flutter camera-plugin shape) lives in the ENGINE so every shell gets it:
//     a std::thread render loop owned by the viewer; completion via wgpuQueueOnSubmittedWorkDone;
//     a ring of shell-provided targets; a target is published only after its GPU work completed;
//     the consumer takes the latest published target without waiting. The only blocking waits
//     happen on the render thread, never on the caller's thread.
//   * Selection / streaming / controller = aether::pointcloud_lod unchanged: Potree
//     updateVisibility, <= 2 uploads per frame, <= 4 loads in flight, parent fallback, Cesium
//     multiplicative controller on minimumNodePixelSize with the point budget as hard ceiling.
//   * PWLOD_PROJ_ORTHOGRAPHIC: node screen size follows CesiumJS Cesium3DTile.js:945-954
//     @113c068e9af3 (pixelSize = max(frustum height, frustum width) / max(viewport w, h), no
//     distance term); adaptive point size follows Potree pointcloud.vs's orthographic branch.
